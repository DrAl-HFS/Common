## Common
Common definitions, types and functions in C source files. No makefiles or libraries here: add source to target 
makefile and build using settings dictated by project configuration (_fast/compact/accelerated_ and so on).

Modules:-

* **platform** : general system library header includes, macros, tersely named rudimentary types.
* **util** : dumping ground for miscellaneous types & functions.
* **report** : filtered reporting (stdout/stderr).
